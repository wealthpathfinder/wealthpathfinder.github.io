                    <p>Choosing between a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> and <strong>Traditional IRA</strong> is one of the most important retirement decisions you'll make. Get it right, and you could save tens of thousands in taxes. Get it wrong, and you might pay more than necessary.</p>
                    
                    <p>This guide breaks down the key differences, tax implications, and helps you choose the right account for your situation.</p>

                    <div class="key-takeaway">
                        <h4>ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway</h4>
                        <p>Generally, choose Roth if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. Choose Traditional if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket. When in doubt, Roth is often better for younger investors.</p>

        <p>Even if your tax rate drops in retirement, Roth often wins because you pay taxes on the seed (contributions) rather than the harvest (withdrawals). The tax-free growth on decades of compounding is powerful.</p>

<!-- Backdoor Roth Section -->
<section id="backdoor-roth" class="article-section">
    <h2>Backdoor Roth IRA Strategy for High Earners</h2>
    
    <p>If your income exceeds Roth IRA limits, you can still access Roth benefits through this two-step strategy:</p>
    
    <div class="step-by-step">
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 1: Contribute to Traditional IRA</h4>
            <p>Make a non-deductible contribution to a Traditional IRA. There are no income limits for contributions, only for deductions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> Up to $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Form:</strong> File IRS Form 8606 to document non-deductible contributions</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Can do this anytime</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 2: Convert to Roth IRA</h4>
            <p>Convert the Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Since you made non-deductible contributions, only the earnings (if any) would be taxed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Convert immediately to minimize taxable earnings</li>
                <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Pay ordinary income tax on any earnings between contribution and conversion</li>
                <li><strong>No limits:</strong> No income limits for conversions (since 2010)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step">
            <h4>Step 3: File Correct Tax Forms</h4>
            <p>Report both the non-deductible contribution and conversion on your tax return.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Form 8606:</strong> Reports non-deductible contributions and conversions</li>
                <li><strong>Pro-rata rule:</strong> Be careful if you have other Traditional IRA assets</li>
                <li><strong>Consult professional:</strong> Recommended for complex situations</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
        <h4>âš  Critical Warning: The Pro-Rata Rule</h4>
        <p>If you have other Traditional IRA assets (from rollovers, deductible contributions, etc.), the Backdoor Roth IRA becomes complicated. The IRS considers ALL your Traditional IRAs together, and taxes are calculated pro-rata. Consider consulting a tax professional.</p>

                        <h4>Can I have both a Roth and Traditional IRA?</h4>
                        <p>Yes, you can have both, but your total contributions to all IRAs cannot exceed the annual limit ($7,000 in 2025, or $8,000 if 50 or older).</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>Which is better for early retirement?</h4>
                        <p>Roth IRAs are generally better for early retirement because you can withdraw contributions (but not earnings) at any time without penalty, unlike Traditional IRAs.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h4>What happens if my income exceeds the Roth IRA limits?</h4>
                        <p>You can use the "Backdoor Roth IRA" strategy: contribute to a Traditional IRA (no income limits), then convert it to a Roth IRA. This requires filing Form 8606 with your taxes.</p>
