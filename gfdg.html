      If you are new to investing, you have likely heard about <strong>index funds</strong>
      and <strong>ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)</strong>. Both are popular investment options
      known for low fees and long-term growth, but many beginners struggle to understand
      the differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this guide, we’ll explain index funds and ETFs in plain language, compare their
      pros and cons, and help you decide which one fits your financial goals.

    <h2>What Is an Index Fund?</h2>
    <p>
      An index fund is a type of mutual fund designed to track the performance of a
      specific market index, such as the S&P 500 or the Total Stock Market Index.
      Instead of trying to beat the market, index funds aim to match it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because index funds are passively managed, they usually have lower fees than
      actively managed funds. This makes them a popular choice for long-term investors.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Is an ETF?</h2>
    <p>
      An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is similar to an index fund in that it also tracks
      an index or group of assets. The main difference is that ETFs trade on stock
      exchanges just like individual stocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means you can buy and sell ETFs throughout the trading day, and prices can
      change in real time.

    <h2>Which Option Is Better for Beginners?</h2>
    <p>
      For most beginners, index funds are a great starting point because they promote
      disciplined, long-term investing. ETFs are better suited for those who want more
      flexibility and control.
